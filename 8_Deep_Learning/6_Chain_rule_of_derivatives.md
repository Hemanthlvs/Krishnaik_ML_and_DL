# The Chain Rule of Derivatives

## 1. Weight Updation Formula

The **generic formula for weight updation** in deep learning is:
`W_new = W_old - learning_rate * (derivative_of_loss / derivative_of_W_old)`

This formula is applied during **backward propagation** to update weights after forward propagation and loss calculation.

## 2. What is the Chain Rule of Derivatives?

The chain rule is a fundamental concept used to **expand derivatives** when a variable's dependency is indirect or composed of multiple steps. It allows for the computation of each component needed to find updated weights.

### Core Idea:
If `Loss` depends on `O2`, and `O2` depends on `W4`, then the derivative of `Loss` with respect to `W4` can be expressed as:
`dL/dW4 = (dL/dO2) * (dO2/dW4)`

This "splitting" or expansion of the derivative is the chain rule. If the intermediate terms cancel out, the original derivative is restored, confirming the rule's validity.

## 3. Applying the Chain Rule: Examples

### Example 1: Updating `W4` in a Simple Network

Consider a simple neural network with an input layer, a hidden layer (with one neuron producing `O1`), and an output layer (with one neuron producing `O2`).

*   **Goal**: Update `W4`, which connects `O1` to the output neuron producing `O2`.
*   **Formula**: `W4_new = W4_old - learning_rate * (derivative_of_loss / derivative_of_W4_old)`
*   **Chain Rule Expansion for `dL/dW4`**:
    *   The `loss` is entirely dependent on `O2`.
    *   `O2` is dependent on `W4`.
    *   Therefore, `derivative_of_loss / derivative_of_W4_old` expands to:
        ` (derivative_of_loss / derivative_of_O2) * (derivative_of_O2 / derivative_of_W4)`

This expansion helps calculate the slope for `W4`.

### Example 2: Updating `W1` in the Same Simple Network

Now, let's update `W1`, which connects an input to the first hidden neuron producing `O1`. This is more complex because `O2` depends on `O1`, and `O1` depends on `W1`.

*   **Goal**: Update `W1`.
*   **Formula**: `W1_new = W1_old - learning_rate * (derivative_of_loss / derivative_of_W1_old)`
*   **Chain Rule Expansion for `dL/dW1`**:
    *   `Loss` is dependent on `O2`.
    *   `O2` is dependent on `O1` (because `O1` is multiplied by `W4` to get `O2` after activation).
    *   `O1` is dependent on `W1`.
    *   Thus, `derivative_of_loss / derivative_of_W1_old` expands to:
        ` (dL/dO2) * (dO2/dO1) * (dO1/dW1)`

### Example 3: Updating `W1` in a Multi-Hidden Layer Network

Consider a more complex neural network with an input layer, **two hidden layers** (`Hidden Layer 1` with `O11`, `Hidden Layer 2` with `O21` and `O22`), and an output layer (producing `O31` for binary classification).

*   **Goal**: Update `W1`, which connects an input to `O11` and `O12` (assuming `W1` influences both `O11` and `O12` in this specific setup, though the example focuses on `O11` leading to `O21` and `O12` leading to `O22` based on the expanded chain rule). The provided solution specifically traces paths through `O11` and `O12` to `O31` that are affected by `W1`.
*   **Formula**: `W1_new = W1_old - learning_rate * (derivative_of_loss / derivative_of_W1_old)`
*   **Chain Rule Expansion for `dL/dW1`**: This expansion is more complex due to multiple paths contributing to `O31` that eventually depend on `W1`. `O31` is dependent on `O21` and `O22`. Both `O21` and `O22` can depend on earlier layers, and specifically `O11` and `O12`, which are in turn dependent on `W1`.

The expansion involves **addition** for parallel paths that converge at the final output:

`dL/dW1 = `

`(` `dL/dO31` `*` `dO31/dO21` `*` `dO21/dO11` `*` `dO11/dW1` `)` **[Path 1: Loss -> O31 -> O21 -> O11 -> W1]**

` + `

`(` `dL/dO31` `*` `dO31/dO22` `*` `dO22/dO12` `*` `dO12/dW1` `)` **[Path 2: Loss -> O31 -> O22 -> O12 -> W1]**

This comprehensive expansion captures all dependencies of the loss function on `W1`.


You are now a datascience, deeplearning and AI instructor

now I have given a transcript of the one of the videos of the above mentioned course. and given that transcript to notebooklm to generate notes for my .md file and it has given me something like this.
which is good actually.
I want you to make the below notes even good if possible. Also add something if you want to in the notes and rewrite it in a simple english so that I can use this .md file for my reference in future.
Also correct the notes if you feel something is not correct.(if only its important)
create the notes in .md file format so that I can simply copy and paste it.
