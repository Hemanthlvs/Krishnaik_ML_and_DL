# Sigmoid Activation Function:

## 1. Key Information about Sigmoid Activation Function

*   **Purpose:** The main aim of the sigmoid activation function is to transform input values into a range between 0 and 1.
*   **Formula (Forward Propagation):**
    The sigmoid activation function is given by the formula: `1 / (1 + e^(-x))` or `1 / (1 + e^(-z))`.
    This formula is applied during the forward propagation step after multiplying inputs with weights and adding a bias.
*   **Derivative Range:** The derivative of the sigmoid function always ranges between 0 and 0.25.

## 2. The Vanishing Gradient Problem

The primary issue with the sigmoid activation function, especially in deep neural networks, is the vanishing gradient problem.

*   **Mechanism in Backpropagation:**
    *   During backpropagation, weights (e.g., `w2`) are updated using the formula: `w_new = w_old - learning_rate * (derivative_of_loss / derivative_of_w_old)`.
    *   The `derivative_of_loss / derivative_of_w_old` term involves applying the chain rule across multiple layers.
    *   A key component in this chain rule is the derivative of the activation function (sigmoid).
*   **Impact of Small Derivative Values:**
    *   Since the sigmoid's derivative is always between 0 and 0.25, and initial weights (`w3` in the example) are also often small values (e.g., between 0 and 1), their multiplication results in very small values.
    *   In a deep neural network with multiple hidden layers (e.g., hidden layer one, hidden layer two, hidden layer three), these small values (0 to 0.25) are multiplied repeatedly as the chain rule propagates backwards through the layers to update weights in earlier layers (e.g., `w1` vs. `w2`).
    *   This repeated multiplication of small values makes the overall gradient (derivative of loss with respect to weight) extremely small, approaching zero.
*   **Consequence for Weight Updates:**
    *   When this extremely small gradient is multiplied by a typically small learning rate (e.g., 0.001), the resulting update term becomes negligible.
    *   This leads to `w_new` being approximately equal to `w_old`, meaning the weights are barely updated.
    *   **Lack of Convergence:** If weights are not effectively updated, the neural network fails to converge during optimization (e.g., in gradient descent), leading to the loss function getting stuck and not decreasing. This prevents the model from learning effectively.

## 3. Advantages of Sigmoid Activation Function

Despite its disadvantages, sigmoid has some specific use cases and benefits.

*   **Suitable for Binary Classification:**
    *   It is well-suited for binary classification problems because its output range (0 to 1) directly corresponds to probabilities or classification outputs (0 or 1).
    *   It helps in getting clear predictions very close to 0 or 1.
*   **Medium/Smaller Networks:** It can be used to train medium-sized or smaller neural networks.

## 4. Disadvantages of Sigmoid Activation Function

These disadvantages highlight why sigmoid is often avoided in deep learning architectures, especially in hidden layers.

*   **Prone to Vanishing Gradient Problem:** As explained above, this is the most significant disadvantage, particularly for deep neural networks. The derivative being confined to 0 to 0.25 is the root cause.
*   **Function Output is Not Zero-Centered:**
    *   **Meaning of Zero-Centered:** A zero-centered function means its mean is zero, with its output distribution centered around the origin.
    *   **Importance:** Zero-centered functions are crucial for efficient weight updates, especially when using gradient descent. Non-zero-centered outputs can lead to inefficient convergence.
    *   **Analogy (Standardization):** In linear or logistic regression, standardization is performed to bring data points to a zero-centered region (mean is zero) to facilitate efficient coefficient updates during gradient descent. The sigmoid's output (0 to 1) does not have a mean of zero, making it non-zero-centered.
*   **Computationally Expensive:**
    *   The mathematical operations involved in the sigmoid formula (`1 / (1 + e^(-x))`), particularly the exponential `e^(-x)`, are relatively time-consuming for processors to compute compared to simpler functions. This can slow down training.

## 5. Conclusion

Due to the significant drawbacks, especially the vanishing gradient problem and its non-zero-centered output, researchers developed other activation functions like the Tanh function to overcome these limitations. Therefore, sigmoid activation function should generally not be used in all hidden layers of a deep neural network.
