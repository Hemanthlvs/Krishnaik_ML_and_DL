# How the Human Brain Processes Images (and its relation to CNNs)

## Cerebral Cortex
*   The cerebral cortex is a part of the brain responsible for motor functions, eye movement, and orientation.
*   It is connected to the occipital lobe.
*   Visual signals first go to the cerebral cortex because it handles eye movement and orientation.

## Occipital Lobe
*   This region is where sight, image visualization, and image recognition happen.
*   It's responsible for object detection.
*   The entire image is processed and visualized in this region.

## Visual Cortex
*   The visual cortex is present in the occipital lobe, at the back of the brain.
*   It's a crucial region of the brain that receives, integrates, and processes visual information relayed from the retina (in the eyes).
*   The visual cortex is divided into five different layers, mentioned as V1 to V5.

### Layers of the Visual Cortex:

*   **V1 Layer (Primary Visual Cortex)**
    *   This is the first layer the signal goes through after passing from the retina to the visual cortex.
    *   Its main function is to determine the orientation of edges and lines in an image or object. For example, recognizing the edges and lines of a cat or dog.

*   **V2 Layer**
    *   After V1, the information passes to the V2 layer.
    *   Researchers found that V2 processes differences in color (e.g., red, pink, green) and complex patterns.
    *   It also understands object orientation and complex patterns, such as whether an object is round, square, or complicated.

*   **V3, V4, and V5 Layers**
    *   More complex operations like object detection and object recognition usually happen in these layers.
    *   After the signals pass through V3, V4, and V5, the human brain is finally able to visualize and understand the image or object.

## Connection to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
*   Researchers try to replicate the brain's image processing functionality in CNNs.
*   Just as each layer in the human visual cortex processes and pre-processes specific information, CNNs also have layers that perform similar tasks.
*   For example, in CNNs, edges and lines are found using "filters," which is similar to the V1 layer's function.
*   Understanding how the brain processes images helps to understand how a CNN works.
