# AI vs ML vs DL

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) are terms that are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same. Let's understand each one in a simple way.

### What is AI?

AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is the broadest concept. It refers to the ability of a machine to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. This includes things like understanding language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions.

**Example of AI:** 
- A virtual assistant like Siri or Google Assistant. They can understand your voice commands and perform tasks like setting reminders or playing music.

### What is ML?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI. It focuses on the idea that machines can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. In ML, algorithms are used to find patterns in data and make predictions.

**Example of ML:** 
- Email spam filters. They learn from previous emails to identify which messages are spam and which are not.

### What is DL?

Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML. It uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to analyze various factors of data. DL is particularly good at handling large amounts of data and is used in complex tasks like image and speech recognition.

**Example of DL:** 
- Image recognition systems that can identify objects in photos, like Facebook tagging friends in pictures.

## Summary

- **AI** is the broad concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a smart way.
- **ML** is a subset of AI that focuses on the idea that machines can learn from data.
- **DL** is a subset of ML that uses deep neural networks to analyze data.

Understanding these concepts will help you grasp the fundamentals of how intelligent systems work!
