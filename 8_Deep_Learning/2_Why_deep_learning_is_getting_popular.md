# Why Deep Learning is Gaining Popularity

Deep learning has become increasingly popular, especially since 2011-2012. Here are the main reasons for this trend:

## 1. Exponential Data Generation
- Since around 2005, social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and Twitter have been producing massive amounts of data.
- This data growth has been exponential, including photos, videos, text, documents, and emails.
- Initially, companies focused on storing this data, leading to the rise of **Big Data** and technologies like Hadoop, HBase, and Hive around 2011.
- Companies realized they needed to **utilize** this data to enhance products and boost revenue.
- **Deep learning models thrive on large datasets**, making the abundance of data very advantageous.

## 2. Hardware Requirements (GPUs)
- Training deep learning models requires powerful hardware, specifically **GPUs** (Graphics Processing Units).
- The cost of GPUs has decreased, thanks to companies like Nvidia producing high-performance GPUs.
- It is now more affordable to use GPUs, including cloud-based options, enabling the training of larger deep learning models. This accessibility makes deep learning more practical.

## 3. Performance with Large Data
- A key difference between traditional machine learning and deep learning is how they perform with increasing amounts of data.
- Traditional machine learning algorithms often reach a performance plateau after a certain data volume.
- In contrast, **deep learning algorithms continue to improve in accuracy as more data is added**. This strong relationship between large datasets and performance is crucial.

## 4. Wide Range of Applications
- Deep learning is applied in many fields, including healthcare (like medical imaging), e-commerce, retail, and marketing.
- There is likely a use case for deep learning in almost any industry.
- The diverse applications and various techniques available in deep learning build trust in its ability to solve complex problems.

## 5. Excellent Open Source Frameworks
- The rise of **open source frameworks** has significantly contributed to the popularity of deep learning.
- Notable frameworks include **TensorFlow** (developed by Google) and **PyTorch** (created by Facebook).
- These frameworks enable users to perform various deep learning tasks, such as using LSTM, RNN, BERT, and Transformers.
- The availability of open source frameworks has fostered a larger community around deep learning, leading to **more research** and ongoing advancements in techniques.

## Summary
In summary, the growing popularity of deep learning can be attributed to the combination of **vast data availability**, **advancements and decreasing costs in GPU hardware**, the **superior performance of deep learning models with large datasets**, the **broad range of real-world applications**, and the support from **open source frameworks** like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
