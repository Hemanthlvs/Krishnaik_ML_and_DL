# Understanding of N-grams
## What are N-grams?
N-grams are a sequence of 'n' items (words or characters) from a given text. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), they are used to analyze and model language by breaking down text into smaller parts.

## Key Points:
`N`: Represents the number of items in the sequence.
### Types:
`Unigrams`: Single words (n=1)
`Bigrams`: Pairs of words (n=2)
`Trigrams`: Triples of words (n=3)


## Basic Example
Consider the sentence: "I love programming."

`Unigrams`: ["I", "love", "programming"]
`Bigrams`: ["I love", "love programming"]
`Trigrams`: ["I love programming"]

## Why/Where are N-grams Useful?
### Text Prediction: 
Used in predictive text input, like suggesting the next word in a sentence.
### Sentiment Analysis: 
Helps in understanding the context by analyzing word combinations.
### Language Modeling: 
Assists in creating models that can predict the likelihood of a sequence of words.

## Conclusion
N-grams are a powerful tool in NLP that help break down text into manageable pieces for analysis. They are widely used in various applications, from text prediction to sentiment analysis, making them essential for understanding language patterns.
