# Understanding of Named Entity Recognition
## What is Named Entity Tagging?
Named Entity Tagging (NET) is a process in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that identifies and classifies key information in text into predefined categories. These categories typically include names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and more. This helps in understanding the context and meaning of the text.
## Common Categories:
Person: Names of individuals (e.g., "Albert Einstein").
Organization: Names of companies or institutions (e.g., "Google", "United Nations").
Location: Names of places (e.g., "New York", "France").
Date: Specific dates or time expressions (e.g., "January 1, 2023").
Miscellaneous: Other entities that don't fit into the above categories (e.g., "NASA").
## Example of Named Entity Tagging
Consider the sentence: "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in Cupertino, California in 1976."
NET Tags:
Apple Inc. (Organization)
Steve Jobs (Person)
Cupertino (Location)
California (Location)
1976 (Date)

## Conclusion:
Named Entity Tagging is essential for extracting meaningful information from text in NLP. It is widely used in applications like information retrieval, question answering, and text summarization.
