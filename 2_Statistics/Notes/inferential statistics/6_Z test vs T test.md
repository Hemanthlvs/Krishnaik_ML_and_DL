**When to Use T-Test vs. Z-Test**

To decide whether to use a t-test or a z-test, follow these steps:

*   **Step 1: Check Population Standard Deviation (sigma)**
    *   **First, ask yourself: Do you know the population standard deviation (sigma) from the problem statement?**
    *   If the **answer is NO**:
        *   **Always use the t-test**.
        *   (This applies when the population standard deviation is *not* given).
    *   If the **answer is YES**:
        *   Proceed to Step 2.

*   **Step 2: Check Sample Size (n)**
    *   **(Only if you know the population standard deviation)**
    *   **Next, ask yourself: Is the sample size (n) greater than 30?**
    *   If the **answer is NO (sample size is 30 or less)**:
        *   **Use the t-test**.
    *   If the **answer is YES (sample size is above 30)**:
        *   **Use the z-test**.

**Summary in a Nutshell:**

*   **Use a t-test if:**
    *   You **do NOT know** the population standard deviation.
    *   OR, you **DO know** the population standard deviation, but your **sample size (n) is 30 or less**.
*   **Use a z-test if:**
    *   You **DO know** the population standard deviation.
    *   AND your **sample size (n) is greater than 30**.

This systematic approach helps you understand which test to use in different scenarios.
