### Understanding Type I and Type II Errors in Hypothesis Testing

**Key Concepts:**
*   When conducting hypothesis testing, two main aspects are considered:
    *   **Reality**: The null hypothesis can either be **true** or **false**.
    *   **Decision**: Based on your hypothesis testing results, you either **accept** (retain) or **reject** the null hypothesis.

**Possible Outcomes in Hypothesis Testing:**
There are four possible outcomes when comparing your decision with the actual reality of the null hypothesis:

*   **Outcome 1: Correct Decision (Good Scenario)**
    *   **You reject the null hypothesis**.
    *   **When in reality, the null hypothesis is false**.
    *   This is a good scenario because you correctly rejected something that was false.

*   **Outcome 2: Type I Error**
    *   **You reject the null hypothesis**.
    *   **When in reality, the null hypothesis is true**.
    *   This is an **error** because you rejected something that was actually true.
    *   This specific error is called a **Type I error**.
    *   *Note*: This concept is important in machine learning, especially with confusion matrices used for calculating error and accuracy rates.

*   **Outcome 3: Type II Error**
    *   **You retain or accept the null hypothesis**.
    *   **When in reality, the null hypothesis is false**.
    *   This is also an **error** because you accepted something that was actually false.
    *   This specific error is called a **Type II error**.

*   **Outcome 4: Correct Decision (Good Scenario)**
    *   **You retain (or accept) the null hypothesis**.
    *   **When in reality, the null hypothesis is true**.
    *   This is a good scenario because you correctly accepted something that was true.

In summary, **Type I and Type II errors** are the two scenarios where your decision based on hypothesis testing does not align with the actual reality of the null hypothesis.
