**Hypothesis Testing**

*   **What is Hypothesis Testing?**
    *   It is a **very important topic in statistics**.
    *   It is a part of **inferential statistics**.
    *   The main goal of inferential statistics is to make **conclusions or inferences about an unknown population parameter from sample data**.
    *   Since it's often difficult to get data for an entire population, we use sample data to draw conclusions about the population (e.g., about its mean, variance, or standard deviation).

*   **Steps in Hypothesis Testing:**
    The process of hypothesis testing involves several steps.

    1.  **Write the Null Hypothesis (H0)**:
        *   This is denoted by **H0**.
        *   It represents the **initial assumption you are starting with** or the default assumption.
        *   *Example*: In a court, the default assumption is that a person is **"not guilty until proved"**.

    2.  **Write the Alternate Hypothesis (H1)**:
        *   This is denoted by **H1**.
        *   It is the **reverse or opposite of the null hypothesis**.
        *   *Example*: Following the court example, the alternate hypothesis would be that the **"person is guilty"**.

    3.  **Perform Statistical Analysis (Experiments)**:
        *   This step involves conducting **experiments or statistical analysis**.
        *   You use various **statistical tests** specific to sample and population data, such as z-test, t-test, chi-square test, Anova test, F-test.
        *   *Example*: In the court scenario, this is where **proofs are collected** (e.g., DNA tests, fingerprint tests, or any kind of data).
        *   The purpose of this analysis is to decide whether to **accept the null hypothesis or reject the null hypothesis** based on the evidence.

*   **Example: College Pass Percentage**
    *   **Problem**: Colleges in district A state their average student pass percentage is 85%. A new college in the district had a sample of 100 students with a 90% pass percentage and a standard deviation of 4%. Does this new college have a *different* pass percentage?

    *   **Defining Hypotheses for this example**:
        *   **Null Hypothesis (H0)**:
            *   The initial assumption is that the **average pass percentage is 85%**.
            *   This can be written as: **μ = 85%**.
        *   **Alternate Hypothesis (H1)**:
            *   The question asks if the college has a *different* pass percentage, meaning it could be less than or greater than 85%.
            *   This can be written as: **μ ≠ 85%** (mean is not equal to 85%).
            *   *Note*: If the question asked if the pass percentage was *greater than* 85%, H1 would be μ > 85%.
