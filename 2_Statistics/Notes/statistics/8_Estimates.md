# Estimates in Inferential Statistics

## What is an Estimate?
*   An **estimate** is a **specified observed numerical value**.
*   It is used to **estimate an unknown population parameter**.

## Types of Estimates

There are two main types of estimates:

### Point Estimate
*   A **point estimate** is a **single numerical value**.
*   It is used to **estimate an unknown population parameter**.
*   **Example**: The **sample mean (x bar)** is a **point estimate of the population mean (mu)**.
    *   If you have a large population and take a smaller sample from it, the mean calculated from this sample (sample mean) is used as a single value to guess the mean of the entire population (population mean).
*   **Limitation**: A single point value, like a sample mean, might not be enough to accurately represent the entire population mean. It can be significantly different (less or greater) from the actual population mean.

### Interval Estimate
*   An **interval estimate** uses a **range of values**.
*   This **range of values** is used to **estimate an unknown population parameter**.
*   **Purpose**: It addresses the limitation of point estimates by providing a range rather than a single value.
*   **How it's formed**: It often involves taking a point estimate and adding/subtracting a **margin of error**.
*   **Example**: If the sample mean is 60 and the population mean is 65, a point estimate of 60 alone might not be sufficient. Instead, an interval estimate could provide a range like **55 to 65**.
*   This range of values is specifically called a **confidence interval**.
*   Using a range (interval estimate) is considered a more appropriate way to show an estimation of an unknown population parameter compared to a single point estimate.
